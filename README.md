Project: Task Management API

A robust Task Management API project developed using Java and Spring Boot, designed to manage tasks efficiently with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This API project demonstrates my understanding of backend development principles, RESTful service architecture, and API testing practices.

Project Overview:
The Task Management API provides an easy-to-use backend service to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks, making it an ideal backend solution for any task or project management application. The API strictly adheres to RESTful conventions and was developed with a focus on clean, maintainable code and efficient data handling.

Key Responsibilities:
Designed and Implemented CRUD Operations: Developed endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. Each endpoint is built to handle specific HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) and includes error handling for invalid requests.

RESTful API Development: Implemented RESTful design principles to build each endpoint, ensuring clear separation of concerns and intuitive functionality. The API strictly follows REST guidelines, making it highly compatible with various client-side applications.

Database Integration: Used Spring Data JPA to interact with an H2 in-memory database, providing quick and efficient data storage for development. Additionally, the code is compatible with other relational databases like MySQL for larger-scale applications.

Service Layer Architecture: Followed a layered architecture by separating the controller, service, and repository layers, promoting clean code practices and facilitating easy maintenance and scalability.

Comprehensive Testing in Postman: Tested all API endpoints using Postman to verify data integrity, response formats, and error handling. Ensured proper responses (200, 201, 404, etc.) for each endpoint and validated the functionality and stability of CRUD operations.

Error Handling and Validation: Implemented thorough error handling for common issues such as missing resources or invalid data. This includes custom error messages to guide users toward successful API interactions.

Technical Stack:
Backend Framework: Java with Spring Boot
Database: H2 (in-memory for development) and compatibility with other RDBMS systems like MySQL
Data Management: Spring Data JPA for ORM and database operations
Testing Tool: Postman for endpoint testing and API validation
Version Control: Git
Key Endpoints:
POST /api/tasks: Creates a new task with details like title, description, due date, and status.
GET /api/tasks: Retrieves all tasks in a JSON array format.
GET /api/tasks/{id}: Retrieves a specific task by its unique ID.
PUT /api/tasks/{id}: Updates task details for a given ID.
DELETE /api/tasks/{id}: Deletes a task by its ID, with confirmation on success.
Project Highlights:
Demonstrated solid understanding of Java and Spring Boot for backend development.
Applied RESTful best practices to build a clean, modular API.
Tested thoroughly in Postman to ensure stable, accurate API responses.
Implemented modular design for flexibility and ease of scaling.
Utilized efficient database operations and validated data management processes.
Project Impact:
This project highlights my capability to build a structured, fully functional API from scratch using Java and Spring Boot, with a focus on quality, reliability, and efficient data handling. It showcases my ability to develop server-side applications and integrate them with client-side needs, making it ideal for task and project management systems.

This project is a testament to my skills in backend development, API architecture, and database interaction, underscoring my ability to handle real-world requirements and deliver high-quality software solutions.
